Problem Statement
A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase 
behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different 
categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high 
volume products from last month. The data set also contains customer demographics 
(age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), product details 
(product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month.
Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against 
various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against 
different products.
